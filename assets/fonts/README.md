Place a Khmer TrueType font file here and name it `KhmerOS.ttf` (or update `pubspec.yaml` accordingly).

Recommended steps:

1. Download a Khmer TTF (e.g., Khmer OS, Khmer OS Muol, or another licensed Khmer font).
2. Put the TTF file at: `assets/fonts/KhmerOS.ttf`.
3. Run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

4. Rebuild the app. The app theme is configured to use the `Khmer` font family.

If you prefer a different filename, update the `fonts` entry in `pubspec.yaml` accordingly.
